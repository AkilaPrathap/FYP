UTQG Rating: The Uniform Tire Quality Grading (UTQG) rating provides information about treadwear, traction, and temperature resistance. It includes a treadwear number (e.g., 500), a traction grade (e.g., AA), and a temperature resistance grade (e.g., A).

Run-Flat Technology: Some tires are designed with run-flat technology, indicated by markings like ""RFT"" or ""Run-Flat"" on the sidewall. These tires can be driven for a limited distance at reduced speeds after losing air pressure.

Winter Tire Markings: Winter tires may have markings like ""M+S"" (mud and snow) or a snowflake symbol, indicating their suitability for use in winter conditions."
